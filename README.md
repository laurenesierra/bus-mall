# bus-mall

 This is a customer-interest survey for the catalog company, BusMall. They distibute catalogs in busses and public transit. Busmall wants to do a market analysis using an app which will have a customer interest survey. It will display proposed products for manufacturing and will ask users to select the products they are most likely to purchse. It then stores, calculates and visually dispays the score in chart form to the user. It also stores this data in localStorage. Data that BusMall wants to recieve is the number of clicks per product and the percentage of times an item was clicked on when it was shown. CSS was left to designer discretion.
